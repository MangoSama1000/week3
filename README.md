# ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
# I used local storage to save the cookie counter.
# Implented event listners to handle users clicking the buttons to increase the cookie count.
# Tried using functions to try and keep my code clean and readable.
# Tried using set interval to increment cookie count.
# Made an upgrade which costs 10 cookies that gives 10 cps, but should've made it 1 cps.
# ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
# I think i tried most of the requiremnets but i think my execution was not the best or could be better.
# ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
# I would say I found most of the tasks difficult and took time, I think my time management for this task was poor so my work was not as good as it could have been. Not too happy about this project but for next weeks project, hopefully I manage my time better and ask for help on parts that I get stuck on but been fun so far.
